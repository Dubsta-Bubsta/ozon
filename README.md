# About
This project was made on video from YouTube channel Glo academy. Layout and styles I took from the author. The JS code was implemented by the author and I repeated and understood it. The main reason I started doing this project is to connect Webpack. First used the bash console. Learned to use import/export and split a large JS file into many small modules.  
As a result, I got a good experience with bash, NPM connection and webpack initial stage
